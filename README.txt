I designed whole new portfolio page for my photography course. As I finished whole series of photography, I wanted to make great portfolio page apart from my previous midterm page.

First I designed to make the division showed up after I click the projects’ name, it was too difficult to manage. Therefore, I created separate pages for the each project. The point that I worked on is to make the whole photo shows up when user clicks each thumbnail. To make the column fit was very difficult. Therefore I designated the size of the whole thumbnail. I thought it would not be a problem if the thumbnail just shows the part of the photos as users can see the whole when they click each thumbnail.

So when you click the thumbnail, the big version of photo shows up and the background of the whole list of photo changes into the photo behind the overlay.
Also it looks like simple thing, it was very hard to connect each photos to the background and make it gone when the overlay is hidden again. 

I got some help from Terricka about this problem and she suggested find(“img”).stop() commend which she told me it is very crucial for jquery.
